# Environmental Sound Classification
This project is mainly based on the paper named "An Ensemble One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network with Bayesian Optimization for Environmental Sound Classification".
Here it processed through mainly 10 steps
1.Importing necessory libaries
2.Loading the metadata
3.Extracting features
4.Processing the audio files
5.Create a dataframe for combining the extracted features and labels
6.Preprocess the datas
7.Model building and hyperparameter optimization
8.Model training and evaluation
9.Visualization
10.Presenting the results

Here I'm used UrbanSound8K dataset, which is a publically available dataset. It containes 10 classes.
